Building the member graph required three nested loops, one of size G, and 2 of size K.  The numer of groups each member joins and the 
number of connections they have does not affect the big O notation because worst case it will run through all of them making the 
big O notation O(G*K^2).

The run time of breadth first search is O(|V| + |E|) and the run time of Iterative deepening depth first search is O(b^d) 
where b is the branching factor and d is the depth of the shallowest solution.
